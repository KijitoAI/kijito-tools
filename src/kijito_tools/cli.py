"""Console entry point: run the bundled bash installer (install.sh).

The bash scripts and skills are shipped as package data under ``_assets/``. We locate
them through ``importlib.resources`` (works whether the package is installed normally or
run via ``pipx run``) and shell out to ``bash``. ``install.sh`` resolves its siblings
relative to its own directory, so we run it with ``cwd`` set to the assets directory.
