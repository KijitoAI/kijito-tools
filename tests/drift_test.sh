# Does this machine RUN what this repo SHIPS?
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. On 2026-07-29 four of nine scripts had drifted between the repo and ~/.claude, with
# the INSTALLED copy ahead by 3 days to 5 weeks — improvements that existed only in an un-versioned
# location. The published packages (npx kijito-claude / pipx run kijito-claude) therefore shipped
# months-old behaviour, and nothing anywhere reported it: lc_test.sh tested the installed copies, so a
# drifted install looked like a passing repo.
#
# Two ways drift happens, and this check names which one you have:
#   • INSTALLED NEWER  → someone edited ~/.claude directly. The edit is real work and is not in git;
#                        copy it back into scripts/ and commit it, or it dies with the machine.
#   • REPO NEWER       → the repo moved and this machine was never re-installed. Run ./install.sh.
# "A merge does not move your local repo, and a pull does not install."
#
# Exit: 0 = in sync (or nothing installed → SKIP), 1 = drift found.
