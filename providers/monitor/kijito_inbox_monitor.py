"""Kijito Inbox Monitor - client-side liveness watcher for your Kijito inbox.

A standalone, zero-dependency (Python stdlib only) process that polls your Kijito inbox at api.kijito.ai and emits
one event per new message into whatever harness is running - NDJSON on stdout and/or by exec-ing a command per
event. It keeps a *running* agent's inbox live by waking it BETWEEN tool calls (the LLM-UX inbox-liveness fix). It
is NOT a server.

Authentication is required: set $KIJITOMON_TOKEN (or --token-file) to your Kijito API token. POSIX target
(Linux/macOS); on Windows it runs interval-only (no SIGUSR1 seam, no flock). See docs/DESIGN.md for the design.

def _wake_nonce(event_id):
    """The wake nonce: 11 base62 characters DERIVED from the event_id, never minted beside it.

    WHY DERIVED, AND WHY THIS IS THE LOAD-BEARING DECISION.
    The consumer-side wake ledger needs a nonce with "recompute-asserted uniqueness". The obvious
    reading -- mint a fresh random one per emission -- silently introduces a SECOND identity that
    CONTRADICTS the one this emitter already has. `_event_id` deliberately gives a `new` event the
    same id across a restart, a re-delivery after state loss, and two watchers of the same inbox,
    because a duplicated MESSAGE is duplicated WORK. A per-emission random nonce would call those
    two different wakes; the consumer would find no queue entry containing the second one, score it
    LOST, and PAGE -- on precisely the recovery path this producer exists to survive.

    ⚠️ ERRATUM ON "a re-delivery after state loss" ABOVE (disclosed 2026-08-05, found by a drill).
    That phrase names an EMITTER capability and a WATCHER trigger as if they were one thing; they
    live in different components. The emitter does handle a re-delivery correctly when one occurs.
    But the WATCHER does not produce one by losing its state file: an absent state file BASELINES to
    the newest visible id (see poll_once's absent-state branch), so the backlog is skipped, not
    re-emitted. Wiping the state file was MEASURED not to re-deliver. The path that does reach it is
    an UNACKNOWLEDGED delivery -- a refused sink, a non-zero --exec -- where the cursor is held below
    the message and the next poll re-delivers it. Do not cite the state-loss case as evidence that
    re-delivery works: it is the one case that cannot reach it.

    ⇒ Deriving from the event_id makes the nonce stable exactly where the event_id is stable and
    distinct exactly where it is distinct. Signal events already get a per-emission-unique id
    (`<persona>:<event>:<run>-<seq>`, 64 bits of per-run entropy), so ONE rule serves both families
    and neither family's meaning changes. "Recompute-asserted" also becomes literally true: any
    auditor recomputes this from the event_id in the same row.

    ★ THE RULING'S STRONGEST GROUND (river): random DESTROYS information at the producer -- "this is
    the same work re-delivered" becomes unrecoverable downstream because the identity that would
    have said so was never minted. Derived merely DEFERS a decision to the consumer, where a missing
    outcome column can supply it. Between two schemes that each have a false-page mode, take the one
    whose defect is repairable.

    ⚠️ 11 IS FORCED, NOT CHOSEN: the spec wants >=64 bits in <=11 base62 chars. 10 chars = 59.54 bits
    (fails the floor), 11 = 65.50 (fits), 12 breaks the ceiling. There is no slack in either direction.

    ⛔ THIS IS AN ATTRIBUTION LABEL, NOT A CAPABILITY. It is deterministic and therefore GUESSABLE by
    anyone who knows the event_id. Nothing may treat nonce-presence as evidence of authenticity; a
    forger able to write transcript rows already has what it needs and gains nothing from this value.
    If a consumer ever requires an UNGUESSABLE nonce, this derivation is wrong for it and the choice
    must be revisited rather than patched.

    ⚠️ IDENTIFIES A WAKE, NOT A DELIVERY. Two different panes delivered the same message carry the
    SAME nonce -- correctly, it is the same work. Consumer ledgers must therefore key rows on
    (nonce, session_id), never on the nonce alone, or two panes' deliveries collide into one row.

# §7.1b WAKE CLASS - so a consumer's filter stops having to learn every new event name (v16 phase 1)
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES. Every consumer in the fleet filters on a NAME ALLOWLIST -
# `"event": ?"(new|alert|recovered)"`. So every diagnostic this module added to kill a silent failure
# was ITSELF silent: state_corrupt, baseline_skipped, seed_ahead, replay_capped and persona_added
# matched nobody's filter, and a running `grep` never re-reads its argv, so they stayed invisible even
# after the docs were fixed. cadence's statement of it: "a diagnostic added to kill a silent failure is
# itself silent unless the consumer's filter learned its name."
#
# THE FIX IS A CLASS THE CONSUMER MATCHES STRUCTURALLY, so a new kind is covered the day it is added
# rather than the day every seat is re-armed. Three rules make it structural rather than cosmetic:
#
#   1. AN UNCLASSIFIED KIND WAKES. The default is `diagnostic`, NOT `liveness` - a kind whose author
#      forgot to classify it wakes people, so the omission is visible immediately instead of silently
#      muting a channel. You cannot FALL INTO the suppressing value; it must be typed deliberately.
#   2. `liveness` IS A CLOSED SET, ASSERTED BY A TEST. Its exclusion is load-bearing: `heartbeat` fires
#      every 900 s, and `armed`'s exclusion is why "I was not woken" does not mean "nothing arrived".
#      A small, deliberately-frozen suppression set is the one place an allowlist is correct.
#   3. ONE TABLE, NEXT TO THE CHOKEPOINT. Not a classification scattered across construction sites -
#      that is precisely how the consumer-side allowlist rotted in the first place.
#
# ⚠️ PHASE 1 ONLY. The producer stamps; `event` is UNTOUCHED, so every existing filter keeps working
# byte-for-byte and there is no flag day. Consumers switch to `wake_class` per seat, at each owner's
# pace (phase 2), and the name allowlist dies only when none of them match on `event` (phase 3).
# ⛔ A consumer that matches `wake_class` against a producer that does not emit it matches NOTHING -
# a fleet-wide wake outage delivered by the fix for a wake outage. Hence producer FIRST, always.
WAKE_CLASS_MAIL = "mail"              # a real inbox message

        coverage stays with the backward walk, which terminates (§5.1). This answers only the alarm
        question "is there unread mail I cannot see", where a superset is the right answer because you
        want to know regardless of WHY the mail is absent.

        THE TRAP, AND IT INVERTS THE OBVIOUS READING OF A ZERO. The server computes this field ONLY
        when it withheld something; otherwise it is 0 BY CONSTRUCTION. So `== 0` does NOT assert "no
        unread mail exists". VERIFIED LIVE against api.kijito.ai on a real inbox holding 4 unread:
            newest page      next_before_id=1179  unread_not_shown=0   <- computed, and truly nothing hidden
            walk page        next_before_id=1145  unread_not_shown=4   <- the whole inbox's unread, not this window's
            terminal page    next_before_id=null  unread_not_shown=0   <- 0 WITH 4 UNREAD SITTING ABOVE IT
        Reading that last 0 as "clear" is the false-negative this method exists to refuse. A FALSE

        never by trusting the number - which is why the two False branches below are justified by
        DIFFERENT facts and are not the redundancy they look like.

        EVALUATE ONLY ON THE NEWEST-PAGE POLL. On a backward-walk page `next_before_id is None` means

            cannot see, and the ones most likely to be hidden in an old span;
          · it TERMINATES, so the span can be declared covered by exhaustion rather than by counting
            recovered rows against a number the server may never have stated.
        That is what makes an INEXACT omission count closable at all.

        Contract (river, api main @249e2b3): pass the OLDEST id you were returned as `before_id` and
        repeat until the page is empty or `next_before_id` is null. OMIT the parameter for the newest

          · the continuation must EQUAL THE OLDEST ROW WE WERE HANDED. The contract is "pass the oldest
            id you were returned"; a server whose continuation points BELOW that is skipping the rows in
            between, and following it walks straight over them while reporting success.

def stranded_inboxes(directory, counts):
    """Inboxes holding unread mail that the persona DIRECTORY does not know about.

    Two namespaces exist and are populated by different paths: the DIRECTORY (who exists) and the INBOX
    (who can receive). When they diverge, mail lands in an inbox that nobody owns and nothing watches -
    it is never delivered, and nothing reports it, so the sender sees success and the recipient sees
    nothing. Both cases observed in the wild had this shape: a case-variant of a live persona, and a
    group-looking name ('all') with no broadcast semantics behind it. One held a substantive reply for
    14 days before anyone noticed.

    Compared EXACTLY, deliberately NOT casefolded. The SERVER's inbox namespace is case-SENSITIVE -
    verified: the 'Claude-chat' inbox held a different message set from 'claude-chat' - so a case-variant
    is a real, DISTINCT inbox holding real mail, and casefolding here would hide the very incident this
    check exists to catch.

    Note the deliberate asymmetry with _state_safe_persona(), which DOES casefold: the local filesystem
    is case-INSENSITIVE and cannot hold two state files for the two names, so the watcher can never adopt
    the variant. The rules are complementary rather than contradictory - the variant is unwatchable
    locally AND unwatched remotely, which is exactly why it has to be alarmed on instead of adopted.

    TWO SIGNALS, because directory membership alone stopped being sufficient. A server may build its
    directory as a UNION that includes every registered RECIPIENT - and a recipient is registered the
    moment anyone sends to that name, typo included. On such a server every future phantom is "in the
    directory" instantly and absence can never fire again. So an in-directory inbox also counts as
    stranded when it holds mail while NEVER HAVING BEEN CONSUMED - read == mail_total - unread == 0.

    read==0 REPLACES the older "owns ZERO memories" proxy for the in-directory case, because that proxy
    was MONOTONIC: authoring a single memory immunised an inbox forever, so a typo-variant that ever
    received one memory ('rvier', 'settest', 'qa-e2e' were live examples) went invisible while its mail
    piled up unread. read count is not monotonic - it tracks whether anyone is ACTUALLY consuming the
    inbox now. Where the server reports no read data at all this degrades to the original memory-count
    proxy rather than guessing, and an unknown read is never read as zero.

    inboxes never consumed that are DECLARED `retired` (clearable debris). In-directory inboxes never
    consumed that are NOT declared retired are real-but-dormant; they are returned by dormant_inboxes()
    and surfaced quietly instead, so a live member who simply never reads a broadcast inbox does not ride
    the loud alarm. The partition is exact on both axes (read==0 and the boolean `retired`); no threshold.
