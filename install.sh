# kijito-claude — provider dispatcher.
#
# This repo installs the Kijito session toolkit for more than one agent host. Each host is a
# PROVIDER under providers/, owns its own installer, and installs to its own location:
#
#   claude  (default)  providers/claude/install.sh    → ~/.claude          — bash scripts + skills
#   codex              providers/codex/install.mjs    → WITHDRAWN notifier; skills-only remains safe
#
#   ./install.sh                      # claude, unchanged from before the providers/ split
#   ./install.sh --provider codex     # WITHDRAWN; use only with --skills-only
#   ./install.sh --list-providers
#   ./install.sh --from-main          # install the stable main bytes (branch-state-immune)
#   ./install.sh --allow-branch       # deliberately install THIS branch's bytes (off-main opt-in)
#
# ⚠️ THE DEFAULT IS LOAD-BEARING AND MUST STAY `claude`. `npx kijito-claude` and
# `pipx run kijito-claude` both land here with no arguments, and they have been installing the
# Claude toolkit since 0.1.0. Changing the default would silently retarget every existing user.
#
# ⚠️ ROLLOUT SAFETY — WHY --from-main EXISTS (two independent wrongs, measured 2026-08-08 by assay):
#   (1) the installer COPIES files into ~/.claude — a deployed hook/skill is a COPY, not a symlink,
#       so it NEVER tracks the repo after install; and
#   (2) the install reads the CURRENT WORKING TREE, whose bytes follow whatever branch is checked
#       out — so a fleet seat that runs a bare `./install.sh` while this SHARED checkout sits on
#       someone's feature branch silently bakes that branch's in-progress bytes into its hooks.
#   Either wrong alone is survivable; together they let a seat converge on stale/unreleased bytes
#   with no error (only reading the installed CONTENT catches it). So main is the documented fleet
#   path (--from-main, installed via a detached worktree so the caller's branch is untouched), and
#   installing from any OTHER branch is made OPT-IN (--allow-branch) — a mere warning still installs
#   the wrong bytes for anyone who does not read it, so the unsafe path must be opt-in, not opt-out.
#   (A non-git checkout — npm/pipx packaged release — has no branch to be wrong about, so it is
#   exempt: the bytes ARE the release.)
#
# Unrecognized arguments are passed through to the provider's own installer untouched, so a
# provider can add flags without this file needing to know about them.
