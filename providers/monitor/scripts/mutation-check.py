"""Behavioural mutation check: break each guarantee on purpose, confirm the suite NOTICES.

WHY THIS EXISTS. A green suite is not evidence. It says the tests pass, not that they can FAIL when the
behaviour they name is removed. Every fix in this repo is verified by deliberately reintroducing the bug
and requiring the suite to go red; anything that survives marks a test that is decorative.

WHAT IT REFUSES TO COUNT AS A CATCH, each learned from a mutant that lied here:
  · a mutant whose pattern is no longer in the source  -> VACUOUS (the code moved; the test proved nothing)
  · a mutant that does not COMPILE                     -> proves the suite noticed a SyntaxError, not a defect
  · a mutant where nearly every test ERRORS            -> the program crashed rather than misbehaved
Only a compiling mutant that produces FAILURES counts.

USAGE
    python3 scripts/mutation-check.py          # exits non-zero if any mutation survives

EXTENDING IT. MUTATIONS is a list of (label, pattern, replacement) or (label, [(pat, rep), ...]) for
multi-part edits. Each entry must remove exactly ONE guarantee. When a mutation survives, ask three
questions before adding a test: is the property untested, is the code under test the code that actually
RUNS (a duplicated implementation will hide this), and could an OLDER guard be catching the scenario first?
All three have happened in this repo.
